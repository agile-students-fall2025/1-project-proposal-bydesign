# Crux
*Train smarter. Climb harder.*

## What and Why

Built by climbers, for climbers, **Crux** personalizes training schedules with science-backed principles. 

Our sport is a full-body one—climbers need finger strength, mobility, endurance, and power—and balancing these elements in a week can be a nightmare. To solve this, Crux generates  adaptive regimens tailored to your needs and goals, helping you train smarter and climb harder.

### For Whom

This software is for climbers who have faced the same questions we have: 

 - How do I get stronger, faster, without overtraining?
 - How do I maximize the return on investment of my training?
 - How do I train around my busy schedule?

If you love climbing, chances are you've faced these issues yourself. If so, we're building **Crux** for you.

### Core Features

Crux's core features are its **Benchmark** and its **Schedulizer**. The two work in a tandem loop to optimize training schedules. 

The **Benchmark** collects key user data (i.e., *life schedule*, *strength metrics*, *goals*, etc.) and stores it in the user's profile. Behind the scenes, these metrics are compared to available databases to identify the user's *strengths* and *training priorities*. 

The **Schedulizer** combines the results of the Benchmark with the user's goals to generate a training schedule optimized with proven sports science, including progressive overload and phase structuring. 

The Benchmark and Schedulizer work in a loop to allow **Crux** to adapt to each athlete's changing needs. Intermittently, users retake the Benchmark, and the Schedulizer adapts accordingly. **Unlike static training templates, Crux continuously adapts as you progress.**

### Stretch Goals
  - **Workout Buddy**
    - All-in-one, hands-free timer, tracker, and organizer for common workouts like fingerboarding and edge lifts.
  - **Performance Graphs**
	  - Visualize trends like strength gains, climbing grades, etc.
  - **Community**
	  - Leaderboards, streaks, badges, followers, etc.
  - **Third-party integration**
	  - Import health data from one or multiple existing web APIs like Strava, Oura, and Garmin.

### Scope
The two core features can be prototyped using standard technologies for user input and data collection but leave a *huge* amount of room for innovation and optimization. This ensures the project is appropriately challenging from the start while offering plenty of room to expand as the team's capabilities grow.
